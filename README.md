# Hey, I'm Aaron 👋

## About me

I'm a Member of the Technical Staff at Anthropic. Previously, I was the founder of [Regression Games](https://regression.gg), where we built tools for automated game testing. I've also worked on:

* 🤖 Machine learning product and infrastructure at [Instabase](https://instabase.com)
* ⚛️ Quantum compilers at [Rigetti](https://rigetti.com)
* ♿️ Automated accessibility testing at [MIT CSAIL](https://csail.mit.edu) under my project called [Bility](https://github.com/vontell/bility)
* 🏥 Health applications at [Cigna](https://cigna.com)

Outside of technology and work, I'm an avid gamer, mostly as an [ADC main in League of Legends.](https://mobalytics.gg/lol/profile/na/dijkstraspath-na1/overview)

I'm extremely passionate about agentic systems, exploring how non-AI folks can best use AI, and computational complexity theory.

I'm also a contributor to [PHLask](https://github.com/phlask), a Philadelphia-based project to help people find resources such as water, food, and bathrooms in the city.
