# Hey, I'm Aaron 👋

## About me

I'm the founder of [Regression Games](https://regression.gg) where we build tools for automated testing in games using cutting-edge AI technology. In the past, I've worked on:

* 🤖 Machine learning product and infrastructure at [Instabase](https://instabase.com)
* ⚛️ Quantum compilers at [Rigetti](https://rigetti.com)
* ♿️ Automated accessibility testing at [MIT CSAIL](https://csail.mit.edu) under my project called [Bility](https://github.com/vontell/bility)
* 🏥 Health applications at [Cigna](https://cigna.com)

Outside of technology and work, I'm an avid gamer, mostly as an [ADC main in League of Legends.](https://mobalytics.gg/lol/profile/na/dijkstraspath-na1/overview)

I'm also a contributor to [PHLask](https://github.com/phlask), a Philadelphia-based project to help people find resources such as water, food, and bathrooms in the city.
